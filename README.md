Sample implementation of Criag Reynolds [flocking boids](http://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/) algorithm using the olc::PixelGameEngine 
from [One Lone Coder](https://community.onelonecoder.com), another great [channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-yuWVUplUJZvieEligKBkA).

This is very much inspired by the [Nature of Code](https://thecodingtrain.com/learning/nature-of-code/) from The Coding Train which breaks down 
many of the techniques here, check it out.
